# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a social media website.
This project is licensed under the GPLV3, which means all forks must be licensed under the GPL.
If you find a bug make a Pull request that fixes the bug or file an Issue.

A more stripped down version of the website is being developed on notabug, it is not ready and is more of a test to see how much less code there can be while still keeping some of the basic features intact.

You can check out the more stripped down version's source code here: https://notabug.org/Slitnical/LetsChat.git
