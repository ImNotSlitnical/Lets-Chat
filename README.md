# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a social media website.

This is the original version of LetsChat, it is similar to NeoChat because it is the direct predecessor to NeoChat. LetsChat was originally supposed to be a full social media platform, but that idea was abandoned. Now LetsChat is a web framework on which you can build a social media platform, and NeoChat is built on top of it. NeoChat was built on top of the original LetsChat because the original version already had the required features.

This build has been made public for the sake of history, the login page in this was extracted from the <a href="https://github.com/Project-LetsChat/Math-Quiz.git/">Math-Quiz</a> repo. The login page for this is now the present-day login page in NeoChat.
