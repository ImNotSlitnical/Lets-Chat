## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you find a vulnerability then file an issue, don't expect it to be accepted or a reason for why it has been declined.
